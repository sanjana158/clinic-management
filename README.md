# clinic-management
clinic management done with Django and React frontend
This project uses Django REST Framework token-based authentication for securing API endpoints.
In the Postman collection, the {{BASE_URL}} variable can be used to simplify requests. For now, all requests are pointing directly to the API root (e.g., http://localhost:8000/api).
I am exploring JWT-based authentication for a more robust solution in the future, but this is not implemented yet.
